OnTheWeb PythonicApple (Retro Snake Game) made with Transcrypt-Python

# Origin and Changes
OTW Pythonic Apple is based on one of my favorite retro games, Snake. 
The original game, or the closest to the original game online version, 
can be found at https://snake97.com/. This version of the snake game, 
Pythonic Apple has many of the same rules, but is different from the 
most versions of the game in 4 very different ways:

	1. there are obstacles that protect the apple from being eaten,
	2. the canvas where the snake game is played on bounces around 
	   the screen in a predicted way after a certain score is reached,
	3. the canvas randomly changes color after a certain score is 
	   reached, and 
	4. only two buttons work in this game: the left and right arrow keys.
