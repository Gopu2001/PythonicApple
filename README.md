OnTheWeb PythonicApple (Retro Snake Game) made with Transcrypt-Python

# Origins and Differences
This game is very similar to the Retro Snake Game, just with some minor 
differences. For starters, this game incorporates an obstacle surrounding 
each apple beyond a certain score. No surprise, there, right? Well, I 
made two other very noticable changes to this game that make this game 
harder:

	1. The entire canvas in which the game is played moves around the 
	   screen, though predictably.
	2. The canvas changes color randomly.


If you would like to download this game, I will publish a downloadable 
version of this game soon. To play this on the web, go to
